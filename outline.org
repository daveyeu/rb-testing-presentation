** Running Selenium
*** Installing webrat and selenium-client
    gem install webrat -v0.7.0
    gem install selenium-client

    Webrat includes a fairly recent Selenium jar (2.0 alpha 1).

*** Firefox 3.5.7
    There are issues with 3.6.x, which may or may not be
    resolved with the latest Selenium jar (2.0 alpha 2),
    which isn't included in Webrat yet anyway.
